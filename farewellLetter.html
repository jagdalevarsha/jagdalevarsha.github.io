<p><br />
<tt>Dear VMware,<br />
<br />
I think writing is easy, until one has to pen down a farewell letter. I realized how blessed I&rsquo;ve been when I struggled to pick the best of VMware memories to include here. I&rsquo;m so spoilt for choices. I&rsquo;m just going to blame you all for this, kidding!<br />
<br />
Few years ago we were trying to research the culture of the design team and by extension of VMware. Naive me thought we needed new research methods for it. A few years since then, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that no novel research method could have done justice. For culture is one those things that is felt and not intellectualized.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;ll try my best to describe what our culture felt like. The feeling of a team was transcended to be that of a tribe. The tribe that held space for my voice, actions, determination, curiosities, needs, pranks, jokes, ideas, pushbacks, aspirations, failures, and disappointments. You held space for me to be me. As tribe mates do. This tribe is the embodiment of &ldquo;utmost care&rdquo;. The only action I can take is to stay true to tribes&rsquo; caring spirit even after. The only hope I have is for this tribe to come together some time again.<br />
<br />
Sincere thanks for being some of the best humans to observe and admire. Thanks for the moments that have filled my heart with warmth, sharpened my mind, and delighted my spirit. I do ask forgiveness for mistakes of mine.<br />
<br />
Last, more than a tribe mate, I will remember you as a privilege that I&rsquo;ve been blessed enough to have had. For which I shall ever be grateful.<br />
<br />
Varsha </tt></p>
